# History and Library

MomentAI gives users two reflection surfaces after sessions.

## Sessions History

Users can browse previous sessions with:

- Brain dump preview text
- Session timestamp
- Helpful tip count
- Analysis status

This helps users notice patterns and revisit tough moments with context.

## Tips Library

Users see all right-swiped tips across sessions in one place.

Library entries include:

- Tip content
- Tag
- Original session context

## Product Value

- Reinforces progress and continuity
- Reduces repeated decision fatigue
- Turns one-off support into a personal coping toolkit
