# AI Coaching Analysis

MomentAI uses an ADHD-aware coaching style designed for emotional safety and practical action.

## What The AI Produces

Each analysis returns:

- `empathy`: a short validating response
- `identifiedProblems`: the key issues hidden in the dump
- `tips`: 3-5 actions with priority, category, and time estimate

## Tip Design Principles

Tips are meant to be:

- Small enough to start immediately
- Specific and concrete
- Shame-free in language
- Balanced across immediate help, mindset, and habit support

## Personalization

The system uses a user's past helpful-tip signals to prioritize tags they respond to best.

## Language Behavior

- Supports English and German
- Responds in the same language as the input

## Safety Boundaries

The AI behaves like a supportive coach, not a clinician.
It avoids diagnosing, scolding, or giving medical advice.
