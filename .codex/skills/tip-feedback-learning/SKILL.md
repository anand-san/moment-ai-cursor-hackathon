# Tip Feedback Learning

MomentAI learns from quick user feedback during tip review.

## Swipe Meaning

- Right swipe: this tip helped me
- Left swipe: this tip did not help right now

## What Gets Learned

When a tip is swiped right, the app increments that tip tag in user preferences.

Tracked tags:

- break
- movement
- breathe
- simplify
- environment
- social
- timer
- reward
- acceptance

## How Learning Is Used

Higher-performing tags for a user are prioritized earlier in future tip lists.

## Why It Matters

- Support becomes more personal over time
- Users get more of what works for their real life
- The app adapts without asking users to fill long settings forms
