# Brain Dump Session Flow

This is the main journey users take in MomentAI.

## Step 1: Capture What Is On Your Mind

Users start from Home and choose:

- Voice input (tap to speak, tap to stop)
- Typing mode (manual text entry)

When submitted, the app creates a new session.

## Step 2: AI Summary

The session summary screen shows:

- The original user text
- Identified core problems
- A short empathy response

If analysis does not exist yet, it is generated automatically.

## Step 3: Tip Review

Users move into a swipeable tip stack:

- Swipe right = helpful
- Swipe left = not helpful

Users can also ask for a fresh set of tips if the first set does not resonate.

## Step 4: Session Result

At the end, users see the helpful tips they saved from that session.

## Step 5: Long-Term Memory

Over time, helpful tips appear across:

- Tips Library (all saved tips)
- Sessions History (past sessions and outcomes)
